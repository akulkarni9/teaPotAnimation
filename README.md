# Animating TeaPot 
### Welcome to Computer graphics 101
#### Note: This is for learning purposes, I've removed main functionalities and included only animation feature... I've also given simple instructions to install required tools for compiling and running this program  
`sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglew-dev  
&& mesa-utils  `

After installing required tools, you should check if necessary tools are missing... So run this command.  
`sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev`  

Once it is executed, run the program by this command:  
`g++ mainCode.cpp -o mainCodeApp -lglut -lGLU -lGL`  
This will create an executable file `mainCodeApp`. Run that executable file by using  
`./mainCodeApp`      

You can learn more about `GLUT` and `openGl` in this link: http://math.hws.edu/bridgeman/courses/324/s06/doc/opengl.html      

Happy learning :)
